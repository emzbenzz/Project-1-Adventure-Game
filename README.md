# Project-1-Adventure-Game
This is UFO escapism adventure game I created for my Master's program. 
I was inspired by spooky season since I created this experience in the fall. I wanted to implement a UFO element that flies around the page.
I added the wolves from the Twilight movie because at the time of creation, the 20th anniversary of the first book was happening in real time.
I also really enjoy emojis as a form of communication and wanted to include them in this project as well.
